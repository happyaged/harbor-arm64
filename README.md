# harbor-arm64
The code clone from the goharbor/harbor ï¼Œand I made some modify for building the image and  offline package for ARM64.

The docker harbor for ARM64 architecture is not officially supported and maintained. It is only used as a test and has 
not undergone a lot of tests. I put it in the development branch.
